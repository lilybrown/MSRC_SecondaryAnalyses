# MSRC_SecondaryAnalyses_Beta
This is a beta page demonstrating plans for secondary analyses through the MSRC.  This webpage is just an example of the work that is intended to be completed by Drs. Lily Brown, Daniel Taylor, and Joshua Wiley.  Completion of this website will be dependent on permission from the MSRC.  This website is being provided to demonstrate the potential utility of the project entitled "PTSD as a Moderator of the Relationship between Insomnia, Nightmares, and Suicidal Behavior."

First, we will describe information on the clinical measures most associated with suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). The number of included items will be dependent on model performance, but we aim to include no more than 10 items based on their relative accuracy. This section will include item-level descript, psychometric properties of the measure from which individual items were selected, and relevant citations.

Next, we will describe all items that were included in the machine learning model.  This will provide clinicians with a sense of which variables ended up being less important in predicting SI and SB. 

Finally and most importantly, a clinical tool will be provided, modeled from a tool previously created by Co-I Joshua Wiley, Ph.D. While this tool was generated from another content area, the models from which the tool was conceived and the clinical utility of the tool will be similar.

For an example of this clinical tool, please see: http://jwiley.github.io/score-proje

Consistent with the Score Project tool, the MSRC tool will allow for the recording of variables of clinical relevance and predictive validity.  For instance, there may be an entry for score on an item from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, or for a demographic characteristic.  

Importantly, this website will be maintained, with permission from MSRC, and will be freely accessible for use by active duty military personnel and the broader community.
